Note that when you load a webpage with a live code chunk that loads packages, a black dot will flash at the top right of each code chunk (just to the left of the Run Code button) until all of the packages are loaded. Only then will you be able to run the live webr code chunks.\nAlso note that each live webr code chunk will start with {webr-r} rather than {r} for static code chunks.\nThe below is a live, or dynamic code chunk.\nCheck out the live webr code chunk in the next chapter (which does use packages beyond base R).",

Functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from other functions.\nA common acronym used in R programming is “DRY” for don’t repeat yourself. If you find yourself using the same chunk of code repeatedly (cut, paste, edit), it is probably worth rewriting the code as a function.\nYou can build your own functions in R using the function keyword. Here’s a simple example that adds 2 to an input number:\nNote that we added a print statement so that you know when the function is installed in the Environment.\nTo use this, you can call the function with an argument:\nExperiment a bit with the code block above, and change the argument number to something different, then run it to get the result. It adapts to a new input, and runs the same function.\nYou can even go back to the function block above, and change the what the function does to add three or subtract two. Be sure to run it again to save the new function before you run the function call in the lower block.\nA function has 3 (sort of 4) parts:\nFor the function below, think about:\nname: square  formal argument: x  body: x ^2\nRun the code chunk above to create the square function in the Global Environment.\nNow try to call the square function in a new code block. Fill in an appropriate argument, then run it.\nSome functions generate intermediate results and final results, or may generate more than one piece of output. If this is the case, you may need more control of what is returned by the function. You can do this by combining the components into a vector, a dataframe, or a list, and then return(x) at the end of the body of your function, so that it does not just return the last result. Some people prefer to specify what is returned at the end of the body of each function, just to make it clear. Let’s look at an example.\nRun the function above until the black dot stops blinking. Then it should be an object in the Environment. At this point you should be able to call the function in the code chunk below.\nExperiment with changing the extremes of the vector, and then calling the function again.

Instead, we want to group the data by patient, and calculate change over time. This requires making comparisons between rows (encounters) to see change over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis gives us change data for sbp and dbp, which is great. The lag(sbp) function uses the sbp value from one row above. If we wanted to compare sbp value in the current encounter to the value from 2 encounters ago, we could use lag(sbp, 2). Give this a try in the code chunk above. Run it to see the output (lots of NAs and a few values). If you want to compare the value in each encounter to the initial value for that patient, you group by patient first, then calculate the change as sbp_change_from1 = sbp - first(sbp). You can use first() and last() after grouping to identify the first and last encounter values for a particular variable. Try comparing the current value for dbp to the first or the last value in the code chunk above. Note that if you want to compare values to the next encounter, you would use the lead() function. Try this out in the code chunk below. Fill in the blank for the value that you want to compare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the last encounter has NAs for change, as there is no lead (next) value for that patient. This is problematic if we want to plot the values (change in BP) over time.\nWe can fix this by piping the result into replace_na(list(sbp_change = 0, dbp_change = 0)).

It gets the name because the result (with method = “lm”) looks a bit like you scattered uncooked spaghetti (straight lines) on the plot. It’s a great way to show changes in data over multiple time points, and there are multiple variants, including summary smoothed lines.\nNote that a bit of data wrangling needs to be done to produce the correct data format for geom_line(). You may need to pivot_longer() to get 1 row of data for each data point, and an id for each individual (multiple points making up a line. This id will often be a patient id (pat_id). We will read in some simulated data below for 4 time points. The variables are time point, the value, ses (2 categories), elderly (2 categories), and pat_id for 8 patients.\nThe code below will illustrate the basic spaghetti plot.\n\noptions(tidyverse.quiet = TRUE)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ndat &lt;- tibble::tribble(~time, ~value, ~ses, ~elderly, ~pat_id, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 7, 2, 1, 2, 3, 9, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 1, 2, 3, 2, 9, 1, 2, 3, 3, 11, 1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 1, 5, 2, 2, 4, 2, 9, 2, 2, 4, 3, 15, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 1, 1, 5, 1, 5, 1, 1, 5, 2, 6, 1, 1, 5, 3, 9, 1, 1, 5, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 1, 5, 2, 1, 6, 2, 8, 2, 1, 6, 3, 13, 2, 1, 6, 0, 0, 1, 2, 7, 1, 4, 1, 2, 7, 2, 8, 1, 2, 7, 3, 14, 1, 2, 7, 0, 0, 2, 2, 8, 1, 6, 2, 2, 8, 2, 8, 2, 2, 8, 3, 16, 2, 2, 8)\n\n\nggplot(dat, aes(\n  x = time, y = value,\n  group = factor(pat_id)\n)) +\n  geom_smooth(\n    formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE,\n    method = \"lm\"\n  ) +\n  xlab(\"Observation Time Point\") +\n  ylab(\"Y\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this plot looks a bit like spilled (uncooked) spaghetti, with a line for each patient. Each patient is the same (default) color. Note that it is critical to group by the patient id (group = factor(pat_id)) so that ggplot knows which points go together as a line. If you remove this bit of code for the group argument, you get chaos from geom_smooth() or geom_line(). We can also let each patient’s line follow their actual values, rather than a fitted line, with a few modifications. Run the example below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow each patient is represented by a line (and points) with more detail than a fitted straight line.\nWe can also chose to color these lines in two classes by ses (SocioEconomic Status) by setting color = factor(ses). We can make the legend neater by putting it inside the plot boundaries with theme (legend.position), and use the x and y range from 0 to 1 to position it. Google how to do these two things, and try to implement them in the code chunk above.\nYou can see the solution below if you get stuck.\n\nggplot(dat, aes(\n  x = time, y = value,\n  group = factor(pat_id), color = factor(ses)\n)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.2)) +\n  xlab(\"Observation Time Point\") +\n  ylab(\"Y\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we want to summarize the overall trend, we can use a geom_smooth() with the default loess smoothing. We set the color to “black”, rather than the color of either SES group. In order to get a single summary curve, we need to turn off the grouping with group = NULL. Note the loess smoothing produces a curve in the code below.\n\nggplot(dat, aes(\n  x = time, y = value,\n  group = factor(pat_id), color = factor(ses)\n)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.2)) +\n  xlab(\"Observation Time Point\") +\n  ylab(\"Y\") +\n  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE, linewidth = 2, method = \"loess\", color = \"black\", aes(group = NULL))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow a challenge for you - how would you make 2 distinct summary curves for the low and high SES groups, each in the appropriate color, but in linewidth = 4?\nTry to modify the code chunk below to achieve this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow a challenge - facet this plot into one facet for the young, and one facet for the elderly.",

Google to find out how to do each of these in ggplot, then implement these in the code chunk above.\n\nSee the initial plot above for CRP with smooth lines for each patient, then try it for FCP.\nNow plot the CRP values, and change the grouping to patid without colors, and use geom_point() and geom_line() rather than geom_smooth to see the CRP trends in black.\nNow plot the CRP values, and add to the aes, color = factor(dz_type) OR color= factor(flare) to group = factor(patid)\nNow plot the FCP values, and add the geom_smooth with group = NULL and color = factor(flare). Also facet_grid by dz_type, and see if you can improve the default legend title and labels (might need to google these).",
