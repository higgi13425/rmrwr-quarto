# Introduction

This quarto book, with the help of wasm and webr, allows you to edit and run code within live code chunks (a capability called quarto-live).

Now it is your turn to write some code.

Add some style and formatting to the gt table below. Replace the fairly generic `opt_stylize` function with your own style (though the six options for opt_stylize can get you started quickly).
Look at some options either [here](https://gt.albert-rapp.de/formatting), or in the {gt} pakage webpage [here](https://gt.rstudio.com/reference/index.html). Experiment with the `fmt_` and the `cols_` families of functions.
Note that you can change opt_stylize to styles 1-6, and the default colors include "blue", "cyan", "pink", "green", "red", or "gray"

```{webr-r}
scurvy <- medicaldata::scurvy
scurvy |> 
  gt() |> 
  opt_stylize(style = 3, color = "red", add_row_striping = TRUE)
```

Consider renaming the columns, by adding code that looks a bit like this
(pick your own favorite column names):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
|> 
cols_label(treatment = "Rx",
          dosing_regimen_for_scurvy = "Dose",
           gum_rot_d6 = "Gum Rot",
           skin_sores_d6 = "Skin Sores",
           weakness_of_the_knees_d6 = "Weakness",
           lassitude_d6 = "Lassitude",
           fit_for_duty_d6 = "Fit")

```
